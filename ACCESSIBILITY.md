# Accessibility Improvements Summary

## Changes Made to Improve Accessibility

### 1. **HTML Structure and Semantics**
- Added proper semantic HTML5 elements (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`)
- Added ARIA roles (`role="banner"`, `role="main"`, `role="contentinfo"`, `role="list"`, `role="listitem"`)
- Added ARIA labels and descriptions for better screen reader support
- Added skip link for keyboard navigation (`Skip to main content`)
- Added proper heading hierarchy with hidden h2 for timeline section

### 2. **Image Accessibility**
- Replaced all "Placeholder Image" alt text with descriptive, meaningful alternatives
- Each image now has specific alt text describing its content:
  - "Historic photograph showing Intel's founding in 1968"
  - "The Intel 4004 microprocessor from 1971"
  - "Intel 8086 processor introducing x86 architecture"
  - And more descriptive alt text for each timeline image

### 3. **Keyboard Navigation**
- Added `tabindex="0"` to timeline cards for keyboard focus
- Implemented JavaScript keyboard event handlers:
  - Enter/Space keys activate card overlays
  - Arrow keys navigate between timeline cards
  - Escape key closes active overlays
- Enhanced focus indicators with high-contrast yellow outline
- Added focus states that mirror hover effects

### 4. **Color Contrast and Visual Accessibility**
- Improved focus indicators with 3px yellow outline (`#ffeb3b`)
- Added high contrast mode support with `@media (prefers-contrast: high)`
- Enhanced footer link contrast and hover states
- Added support for reduced motion preferences

### 5. **Screen Reader Support**
- Added screen reader only content (`.sr-only` class)
- Created live regions for announcing card content
- Added instructions for screen reader users
- Used `aria-hidden="true"` for decorative elements
- Added meaningful aria-labels for navigation

### 6. **Footer Accessibility**
- Added proper navigation landmark with `aria-label`
- Improved link styling with better contrast
- Added focus states for footer links
- Used semantic markup for separators

### 7. **Meta Information**
- Added descriptive meta description
- Improved page title structure
- Added language attribute to HTML element

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
1. **index.html** - Added semantic structure, ARIA attributes, better alt text
2. **style.css** - Added accessibility styles, focus states, high contrast support

### New Files:
1. **accessibility.js** - JavaScript for keyboard navigation and screen reader support
2. **ACCESSIBILITY.md** - This documentation file

## WCAG 2.1 Compliance

This implementation addresses the following WCAG 2.1 guidelines:

- **1.1.1 Non-text Content** - Descriptive alt text for images
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)** - Adequate color contrast
- **2.1.1 Keyboard** - Full keyboard accessibility
- **2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap** - Proper focus management
- **2.4.1 Bypass Blocks** - Skip links provided
