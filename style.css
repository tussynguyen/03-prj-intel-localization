/*
  Explanation for students:
  - @media rules help your page look good on phones, tablets, and computers.
  - The timeline cards stack vertically on small screens.
  - The header and logo get smaller on small screens so everything fits.
  - Use your browser's DevTools (press F12 or right-click and choose "Inspect") and try resizing the window to see these changes in action!

*/
/*
  Explanation for students:
  - width and max-width set to 1080px so only 4 cards are visible at a time.
  - margin: 0 auto centers the timeline-cards container on the page.
  - overflow-x: auto lets you scroll to see more cards.
  - No cards are cut off; you can scroll to see the rest.
  - On smaller screens, the layout changes to show fewer cards or stack them vertically.
  - .timeline-cards uses flexbox to arrange cards in a row (horizontal) or column (vertical on small screens).
  - overflow-x: auto lets you scroll left and right to see more cards on large screens.
  - .timeline-card sets the size, font, and style for each card.
  - :hover adds a simple effect and shows more details when you move your mouse over a card.
  - Media queries (@media) help make the layout responsive for different screen sizes.
  - The footer is centered and spaced away from the timeline.
  - margin and padding make sure the footer does not cover any content.
  - .card-overlay is a special box that covers the card and shows the details when you hover.
  - It uses position: absolute to sit on top of the card.
  - On hover, the overlay appears and shows the description text in the center.
  - scroll-snap-type on .timeline-cards makes the timeline "snap" to each card as you scroll.
  - scroll-snap-align on .timeline-card tells the browser where each card should snap (at the start).
  - This makes scrolling smoother and easier to follow.
  - The scrollbar is hidden, but you can still scroll left and right using your mouse, touchpad, or by swiping on touch screens.
  - This makes the timeline look cleaner.
  - The min-height and max-height make the card taller
  - The description text (inside <p>) is hidden by default.
  - When you hover over a timeline card, the description fades in and becomes visible.
  - This makes the timeline interactive and easy to read.
  - .card-overlay is hidden by default and appears when you hover over a card.
  - The overlay uses a blue background and white text for the description.
  - This makes the description easy to read and interactive.
  - On large screens, .timeline-cards uses Flexbox to arrange cards in a row and lets you scroll left and right.
  - On small screens (700px or less), .timeline-cards switches to a column layout so cards stack vertically.
  - Flexbox makes it easy to change the direction of the cards for different screen sizes.
  - overflow-x: auto adds a scrollbar at the bottom for horizontal scrolling on large screens.
  - gap adds space between each card.
  - align-items: center centers the cards when stacked vertically.
  - scroll-snap-type: x mandatory on .timeline-cards makes the timeline "snap" to each card as you scroll horizontally.
  - scroll-snap-align: start on .timeline-card tells the browser to align the start of each card with the start of the container.
  - This makes scrolling smoother and helps you focus on one card at a time.
  - This makes the timeline interactive and easy to read.
  - .card-overlay is hidden by default and appears when you hover over a card.
  - The overlay uses a blue background and white text for the description.
  - This makes the description easy to read and interactive.
  - On large screens, .timeline-cards uses Flexbox to arrange cards in a row and lets you scroll left and right.
  - On small screens (700px or less), .timeline-cards switches to a column layout so cards stack vertically.
  - Flexbox makes it easy to change the direction of the cards for different screen sizes.
  - overflow-x: auto adds a scrollbar at the bottom for horizontal scrolling on large screens.
  - gap adds space between each card.
  - align-items: center centers the cards when stacked vertically.
  - scroll-snap-type: x mandatory on .timeline-cards makes the timeline "snap" to each card as you scroll horizontally.
  - scroll-snap-align: start on .timeline-card tells the browser to align the start of each card with the start of the container.
  - This makes scrolling smoother and helps you focus on one card at a time.
  - display: flex, align-items: center, and justify-content: center make sure the header and footer content are always centered.
  - flex-direction: column stacks the content vertically.
  - text-align: center makes sure all the writing in the header and footer is centered.
  - background: linear-gradient gives the header a blue gradient background.
  - position: relative and z-index: 1 make sure the header image appears above the background.
  - Check that the image path (src="img/intel-header-logo.svg") is correct.
  - z-index: 2 and position: relative make sure the logo is in front of the background.
  - background: none removes any background-image that could hide the logo.
  - display: block makes sure the image is shown as a block element.
  - margin: 0 auto centers the image horizontally.
  - width: 100px sets the size of the logo.
  - max-width: 90vw makes sure the logo doesn't overflow on small screens.
  - height: auto keeps the aspect ratio of the logo.
  - background: transparent makes sure there is no background behind the image.
  - display: flex makes the footer a flex container.
  - flex-direction: column stacks the items vertically.
  - align-items: center centers the items horizontally.
  - justify-content: center centers the items vertically.
  - width: 100% makes the footer span the full width of the page.
  - max-width: 100vw prevents overflow on small screens.
  - box-sizing: border-box makes sure padding is included in the width.
  - padding: 20px 0 10px 0 adds space above and below the footer.
  - margin: 32px 0 0 0 adds space above the footer. */
